had tortured him instead of raising him.<br>After the deed was done, he 
continued to live his life at the farm,

 all over the farm.<br>Coldwind Farm was quickly settled and the land 
split up and sold off. There was never a buyer for the farmhouse.

 blind eye for the somewhat shady business that took place.<br>Ojomo
            didn't care. He had seen criminal activity up close in his 
homeland and as long as he didn't get involved, he let things be. He 
just fixed cars and handled the crusher. Something he did really well. A
 car went in and a small, metallic cube
            came out.<br>It was not until one gloomy day that he, just 
by accident, saw some blood coming from one of the un-crushed cars. As 
he opened the trunk he found a young man, gagged and with tied hands 
with panic filled eyes. Ojomo freed the
            man who managed to run ten feet before Ojomo's boss stopped 
him and slit his throat. As Ojomo demanded answers he got explained to 
him that he'd been nothing more than a simple executioner as more or 
less every car had a soul in them as this
            was a "service" the scrap yard provided to certain 
"clients".<br>Ojomo snapped and went ballistic. He threw his boss in the
 crusher and let it slowly compress, as the head stuck out, Ojomo 
grabbed it and pulled head and spine out of the body.
            Then he left and was never seen again.</div>

Andrew worked as a lumberjack - a job with its perils. One day,
            Andrew's foreman had to pay Sally a visit, forever changing 
her life. She was alone.<br>Without food on the table and no other 
option, Sally had to find a way, but the only employment she could get 
was at the Crotus Prenn Asylum. Nobody sought
            employment there unless they were in dire need. Just like 
Sally. Without any education, she started at the bottom, doing the hard 
night shift.<br>Over the years, her mind had reached its limits, two 
decades of seeing horrid things that violate
            the eyes. Memories that are re-played every night. Being 
abused verbally and physically, by people without limits. Sally saw 
insanity from the outside, just to catch it herself.<br>Finally she 
could not take it any more and concepts of purification
            emerged inside her. She did what she felt was necessary. As 
the morning staff arrived one day in September - they found over fifty 
dead patients, lifeless, in their bed along four staff members, also 
dead.<br>Only Sally had survived the night,
            but her mind was gone, rocking back and forth non-stop. 
Exactly what happened is only known by her, but it seems that some of 
them had been choked as they had marks around their necks. They got her 
into an ambulance, but that ambulance never
            reached the hospital. It was found crashed in a nearby wood,
 all the staff dead and Sally nowhere to be found.</div>

        <div class="lore">Lisa Sherwood grew up in a quiet village, 
mainly isolated from the rest of civilisation. The people of the hamlet 
were kind and the elders kept old traditions alive, often keeping the 
peace by personally settling the ever-rare disputes. Lisa was
            particularly fond of the charms they taught her to draw for 
safety and good fortune. One night, as she was walking home through the 
woods, a terrible storm struck without warning. Howling winds whipped at
 her hair as she stumbled through the
            swamp, her rain-drenched dress plastered to her skin. In the
 slick, wet mud she lost her footing, careening backwards and striking 
her head against rock. Slipping in and out of consciousness, she 
strained to identify the dark shapes approaching
            her from between the trees. That's the last thing she could 
remember.<br>Her kidnappers kept her chained to the wall in a flooded 
cellar. Though dimly lit, she could see others whose large open wounds 
swarmed with flies. It took merely a
            day before they returned, carving chunks from the prisoners'
 bodies with rusted blades, consuming their very flesh down to the bone.
 Most she saw did not survive long once the cannibals targeted them but 
somehow, deep within, Lisa persisted.
            Starved, infected, and mutilated after several weeks of 
torture, her gaunt arms became loose in their shackles. She pulled hard,
 the metal tearing through skin and muscle until she was free. Her flesh
 oozed viscous yellow pus and bones were
            visible beneath gangrenous wounds. She could go no further. 
Delirious, she thought of home; she thought of the elders. With her 
dying breath, she etched the symbols they had taught her into the floor 
using what remained of her fingers. Almost
            in response, a dark hunger stirred inside her. It yearned 
for blood. In oath, she chose vengeance.<br>The village's search party 
eventually brought them to an old shack in a swamp. Inside, its previous
 inhabitants had been viciously dismembered
            and devoured by an unidentifiable animal. In the cellar, 
amid rotting corpses and disconnected flesh, the elders' charms were 
scrawled in blood on the floor. Lisa's body was not among the bodies and
 was never found. The village was never the
            same again.</div>

of violent electroshock therapy revealed dramatic results and several 
threats to national security were uncovered.<br>Over the years, Herman 
became known as The Doctor and no one
            ever questioned if he had even held a medical certificate or
 even what happened to the prisoners after they had given up their

 a week that the true horror was finally

found dead with all types of head trauma. All personnel and prisoners'

        </div>
        <div class="lore">As soon as Anna was able to walk, her mother 
started teaching her how to survive a harsh, solitary life in the 
northern woods. Living in such an extremely remote and dangerous area 
required skill and resilience. When sunlight became too dim for
            productive activities, they would take refuge in their 
house, a sturdy old cabin constructed to resist the toughest winters. 
Close to the hearth's warmth, Anna would rest in her mother's arms, 
surrounded by the few wooden toys and masks she
            had crafted for her. Drifting off to sleep with stories and 
lullabies, she dreamt happy dreams, ignorant of the events that would 
soon change everything.<br>Anna and her mother were stalking a great elk
 through the woods. They knew it was
            dangerous prey, but it had been a particularly difficult 
winter and they were almost out of food. The spectre of starvation 
frightened them more than any forest creature. Without warning, the elk 
reared, bellowed and charged at Anna. She was
            paralysed with fear as the whole world seemed to shake under
 the immense beast's pounding hooves. The elk was close enough for Anna 
to see the murderous fury in its eyes when her mother threw herself in 
its path, axe in hand. A blood-curdling
            scream escaped from her lips as the elk impaled her upon its
 antlers and hoisted her into the air. With all her strength, she 
brought her axe down on its head again and again while it tried to shake
 her loose. With a sickening crack, the antlers
            snapped and Anna's mother was free. The beast collapsed.<br>Anna
 was too small to move her mother's broken body, so she sat with her in 
the clearing where she had fallen. To distract her from the dying elk's 
cries, Anna's mother held her
            and hummed her favourite lullaby. They stayed like that, the
 huntress and the elk getting quieter and colder, until Anna was alone 
in the silent forest. Eventually she stood up and started the long walk 
back home.<br>Still a child, she knew
            just enough about life in the frozen forest to survive. She 
followed her instincts and became one with the wild. She got older and 
stronger and practised her hunt. As she grew into a dangerous predator, 
her humanity became a half-remembered
            dream.
            <br>She widened her territory and lived off her hunts. She 
worked her way up through squirrels, hares, mink and foxes. Eventually 
she grew tired of them and hunted more dangerous animals like wolves and
 bears. When unsuspecting travellers
            came through her woods, she discovered her new favourite 
prey: humans. Unlucky souls who strayed into her territory were 
slaughtered like any other animal. She liked to collect their tools and 
colourful garments and especially toys when there
            were little ones. But she could never bring herself to kill 
the little girls.<br>Girls she would take back to her house, deep in the
 woods. They were precious, and looking at them woke up something deep 
in her heart. She craved the closeness
            of a loved one, a child of her own. Among the pillaged 
wooden toys, dolls and story books she couldn't read, the girls would be
 tied by the neck with a rough and chafing rope fastened firmly to the 
wall. She couldn't let them wander off, or
            they would surely die outside.<br>Every time, the girls 
would waste away and die of cold or starvation or sickness. Every time, 
it plunged Anna deeper into pain and sorrow and madness. She was 
compelled to try again, and started raiding the
            nearest villages to slaughter families and kidnap their 
daughters. She wore one of the animal masks her mother crafted for her 
so many years earlier to try to calm the frightened children. Villagers 
spread the legend of a half-beast lurking
            in Red Forest: The Huntress, who killed men and ate little 
girls.<br>War eventually came to the forest. German soldiers began to 
pass through, on the march to attack the collapsing Russian Empire. 
During these dark times, there were no more
            travellers. The villagers had abandoned their homes, and no 
more little ones to be found; only soldiers. Many of them were found 
with violent axe wounds. Whole groups disappeared mysteriously. Once the
 war was over, the rumours of The Huntress
            disappeared with it, engulfed by the Red Forest.</div>

        <div class="lore">Kenneth Chase was born in 1932 by a difficult 
labour, which his mother wouldn't survive. This event drove a rift 
between him and his father that never closed. As the boy grew, so did 
his father's resentment, and his drinking habit. By the time
            Kenneth was at school, they lived mostly separate lives.<br>Academically,
 he was unremarkable, coasting by on his significant athletic prowess. 
He grew tall and strong, excelling at track events, but shunned any 
attempts to coax him into
            team sports.<br>On his walk home from school, he would often
 find feathers on the ground and he soon began a collection, keeping 
them in a cigar box under his bed. With his father either at work or in 
an alcohol-induced stupor, Kenneth had
            hours to spend alone, transfixed by the regularity of the 
feathers' barbs and the feeling of softness as he ran them over his 
lips. Watching the birds that came to the feeder in his garden, he 
imagined how soft they must be and resolved to
            catch one. He ingratiated himself with the local dentist, 
soon procuring some anaesthetic. Using this, he rigged up a trap on the 
feeder, that he hoped would knock out a bird long enough that he could 
touch it.<br>After a few failed attempts,
            he managed to trap a robin. As it lay in his hand, he felt a
 sudden rush, of a life at his mercy. He had planned to release it once 
it recovered from the anaesthetic. Instead, as its eyes flickered back 
into consciousness and it began to struggle,
            his grip remained firm. His fingers slowly tightened around 
its throat, squeezing until its chest feathers were finally still. He 
disposed of the body, keeping just a feather, with which he started a 
new collection, discarding the others as
            "fake".
            <br>By the late 1940s, Kenneth had left school and started 
working as a busboy at a local diner. He had also escalated to larger 
prey, like squirrels, raccoons and dogs, becoming skilled at customising
 the anaesthetic dosage for each.<br>In
            early 1954, a young man went missing and the town was turned
 upside down in the search. A few months later, Kenneth's father, while 
doing some work in the crawlspace under the house, found a cigar box. He
 broke it open and saw, to his horror,
            that it contained feathers, animal paws, and a man's finger.<br>Returning
 from work, Kenneth saw his father leaving the crawlspace with a cigar 
box in his hands. He turned on his heel and never went home again.<br>After
 a few weeks of living
            rough, he encountered a travelling circus and, with his 
prodigious strength, was hired to work the ropes. He assumed a new name:
 Jeffrey Hawk.<br>Suddenly surrounded by a close-knit community, 
"Jeffrey" had to learn to socialise. He donned
            a new personality like a disguise, quickly becoming known as
 charming and helpful, and was welcomed into his new family.<br>Over the
 next decade, he stayed with the circus, travelling the length and 
breadth of the United States. But, with
            the itinerant life providing few repercussions, he fell into
 bad habits. Drinks, junk food, drugs, he indulged in all of them to 
excess. For a time, these vices were enough, but then his old urges 
returned and his nomadic existence became
            a cover for him to resume killing. He stole clothes and 
make-up from performers, fashioning a disguise that would let him get 
close to his victims before he anaesthetised them, bringing them back to
 his caravan, where they would awake to find
            themselves bound and at his mercy. He would finally get to 
have his fun, mentally and physically torturing them, their screams 
fuelling him, before being lost in the night.<br>Once their strength was
 at its lowest, he would carefully examine
            their fingers, searching for the prettiest, running them 
over his tongue to find the tastiest. Once he found the best, he would 
cut it from their hand and proudly add it to his collection, disposing 
of the rest of the body as pointless waste.<br>Men,
            women, young, old, he didn't care. The essence of a good 
collection is in the variety, in the memories and stories they evoke.<br>He removed the costume less and less, shedding his old personality with it, fully embracing the clown, his true
            self.
            <br>With time, he became complacent and sloppy. A victim 
managed to work free of her bindings while he was sleeping off the 
drink. She escaped, screaming for help, and he awoke to find the rest of
 the circus bearing down on him. He whipped
            his horse and the caravan disappeared into the night.<br>Since
 then he has roamed the country, a parasite who could always be found at
 a carnival or circus, but who would never be seen on any playbill. He 
lured those brave, or foolish enough,
            to come near, trapped them and moved on before they could be
 found missing.<br>Somewhere along the way, he left the ordinary roads 
of the United States behind him, travelling through a veil of mist and 
entering a new realm. It was a place
            of transience and impermanence, perfectly suiting the life 
he had chosen to lead. Feeling more at home than he had in his entire 
life, he set up camp and waited for his first visitor.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="lore">Rin was the only child of the Yamaoka family. 
She was raised in the dusty halls of a traditional house in Kagawa. She 
studied Education at Takamatsu, a private university, which weighed 
heavily on her family's shaky finances. Her mother got ill
            that year and the bills started piling up. Rin worked 
part-time in a futile attempt to help lighten the load.<br>Her father 
faced a debt that grew without end. He started working double-shifts in 
hopes of obtaining a promotion. That's when
            he started losing sleep. A dark whisper would keep him awake
 all night, reminding him of his hopeless situation. Exhausted, he 
started to lose grasp of reality. Fighting to deny what the voice 
whispered at night, Rin's father made a desperate
            move. He met with his superior and explained his situation. 
He begged for a bonus, an advance, time-off---anything.<br>His request was denied. The company had launched a defective production line that was costing them dearly. Someone had
            to be held accountable and Rin's father fitted the bill perfectly. He was fired after twenty-two years of service.<br>That evening, Rin came home from work. She'd stayed late to entertain customers that lingered at the restaurant. As she
            parked her bike in the shed, she heard her mother's scream come from the house.<br>She
 rushed in, climbing up the stairs to her parents' room. There she found
 bits and pieces of her mother on the floor. Her limbs were clean-cut, 
tangled up
            in an unnatural position. Her breasts were sliced up, 
revealing her rib cage, which was cracked open. Rin gagged.<br>A sharp 
Katana came crashing down. Rin blocked the blade, which bit into her 
bare forearm. The shock of recognition interrupted
            her pain: her father was wielding the Katana with a stoic 
expression. She cried out to make him stop, but he slashed her arm 
again.<br>She rushed off and slid on the blood-smeared floor. Using the 
door frame as support, she raised herself
            up. The Katana ripped through the wall, cleaving her other 
arm. She screamed in pain as she limped into the hallway, only to be met
 by her father's blade.<br>She stepped back, trembling, as she held together the soft loose flesh of her abdomen.
            Images of her mother's tangled limbs flashed before her eyes.<br>Rin
 charged at her father, making him stumble back. He punched her torn 
abdomen and she recoiled in pain. As she struggled to get back up, he 
slashed her thigh, making her collapse
            on the floor.<br>As she crawled towards the stairs, he 
grabbed her hair and yanked her against a partition. The glass shattered
 on impact and she fell through, landing one floor down.<br>She heard 
footsteps somewhere above her. With effort,
            she moved, worming her way into a sea of broken glass. The 
shards gnawed at her, ripping her flesh. He had to be stopped. He would 
not get away with what he'd done to her--with what he'd done to her 
mother.<br>Coughing up blood, her chin
            grazed the glass, adding to the bleeding. A low-pitched 
heartbeat started to ring in her ears. Her body felt so heavy she could 
no longer move.<br>The ground shook with her father's footsteps. She knew she was not going to make it, but she
            no longer cared. She would make him pay, in this life or the next.<br>A
 dark Fog slowly veiled her eyes, but it could not subdue her rage. She 
would not rest--not yet. The darkness whispered, promising blood and 
revenge.<br>An oath was made
            and Rin closed her eyes.</div>

        <div class="lore">Frank Morrison was nineteen and had little to 
show for it. He'd stopped attending school after being kicked out of the
 basketball team for shoving a referee into the stands. Yet Frank was a 
man of potential, who could light up a room despite his
            bleak childhood. At six years old, he'd been taken away from
 Calgary to start a circuit of foster homes. No matter how many times 
he'd lashed out, threw tantrums and got into fights, they'd kept moving 
him to new, unfamiliar houses. His last
            move had been three years prior when his last foster dad, 
Clive Andrews, had picked him up from the adoption centre. They'd been 
on the road for seven hours before reaching a small bungalow in Ormond. 
It would be the longest time they'd spend
            together. Clive was too busy trading cheques from Family 
Services for drinks at the bar.<br>Ormond was a small, stale place; a 
remote town of six thousand inhabitants where grey winters drag on for 
most of the year. Frank did everything he
            could to get into another adoptive family, but he changed 
his mind when he caught the attention of Julie, a beautiful girl who was
 convinced that she deserved better than a life in Ormond, and Frank, as
 an outsider, was her ticket out. Frank
            attended the parties she threw where everyone was younger 
than him and easily impressed, which he liked. He met the impulsive 
Joey, who liked to show off, and the shy, naïve Susie, who was Julie's 
best friend.<br>They would hang out at an
            abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond. Their time together was the
 perfect break from the boring conformity of their small, insignificant 
everyday lives. Frank saw it as an opportunity to shape their lack of 
experience into something powerful. He
            lined up nights of debauchery and rampage, testing their 
limits. Bullying , vandalism, and theft were essentially their weekend 
plans. It came to a point where they would do anything he asked. Nothing
 was off-limits when they put their masks
            on. One evening, Frank dared Joey to vandalise the store 
that had recently fired him. They snuck inside easily enough, as the 
building was supposed to be empty after closing hours. But a cleaner who
 was still there grabbed Julie as soon as
            she came near. Hearing her stifled cries, a dark impulse 
took over Frank. He rushed to her aid, knife in hand, and without 
hesitating, planted the blade into the cleaner's back.<br>As the group 
stared at Frank in shock, he ordered them to
            finish the job. Joey clenched his jaw, grabbed the knife, 
and stabbed the bleeding man in the ribs. Susie didn't want to do it. 
Frank shouted at her; they had to finish what they'd started. Julie 
closed her eyes and slid the knife into the
            man's chest. She handed the wet blade to Susie: they were 
all in this together now. Susie stared at Julie in disbelief as Frank 
grabbed her trembling hands and inserted the knife deep into the man's 
throat. Frank told them to move fast; they
            mopped the blood off the floor, stashed the body in the 
trunk of Joey's car, and drove up Mount Ormond.<br>All four were digging
 in the muddy snow to dispose of the body when Frank spotted something 
moving through the woods. He grabbed his
            knife and broke from the group to check it out. The Fog 
thickened around Frank, becoming so dense that he soon could no longer 
see ahead. He retraced his steps and stumbled onto an ominous trail. He 
followed the eerie path, as if called by
            the darkness. Julie, Susie, and Joey finished digging, but 
Frank was nowhere to be seen. Julie spotted his muddy footsteps in the 
snow and the three of them followed the trail, which took them deeper 
into the woods. When Julie, Susie, and
            Joey did not return home that night, their parents thought 
they'd run away with Frank. Each family came up with a different theory.
 The mood in the town changed, however, when a body was found by an 
abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="lore">When she was five years old, Adiris, the 
youngest of a family of seven, was left on the brick-red burning steps 
of the Temple of Purgation at the centre of Babylon. To process her 
shock and sorrow, she held onto the belief that the Gods had a
            plan for her. Her new life was one of quiet servitude. She 
would tend to the gardens, prepare ceremonial meals, and polish 
ceremonial incense burners. At night, she would pray for a sign that 
would reveal her purpose.<br>When she came of
            age, she attended the high-ranking priests during the yearly
 worshipping of the sea-goat, the God of Water and Creation. Swinging a 
censer down the great hypo-style hall, she cast thick black fumes that 
reached the cold towering stone pillars
            before dissipating. Her worries lifted, and the resulting 
bliss made her feel closer to the Gods than ever. She worked herself to 
the bone each day that followed, fulfilling her duties while taking on 
new ones, as she aided the priests during
            purification rituals.<br>The priests were more and more in 
need of assistance. Cleansings were being performed daily to answer the 
demand from outside the high temple walls, where a catastrophic plague 
had resurfaced. Within months, the priests
            contracted the disease. It did not take long before they 
became too weak to perform any kind of ritual. Adiris, having assisted 
many purification rituals, was the only one able to carry on. The 
swelling panic had to be contained, even if by
            a novice.<br>Anxious before her first ceremony, Adiris 
visited the priests' sanctuary chamber. When she lit the candles, she 
noticed a narrow opening at the back. Sliding through the gap, she 
reached a crypt hidden under the sanctuary. The
            chamber was bare except for the golden statue of a woman, 
who stood with outstretched hands, her fingers covered in jewels. It was
 the sign Adiris had been waiting for.<br>The great hall was packed with
 followers who bowed down as Adiris
            entered. She strode to the brick altar and grabbed a 
ceremonial dagger forged in silver, her ruby ringed fingers wrapping 
around the blade like claws. The sudden display of luxury intrigued the 
followers, who were struck already by her youth
            and beauty.<br>As she began reciting the Epic of Creation, a
 woman at the back swooned and collapsed. Adiris rushed to her and 
noticed the black blisters covering her feet. Without hesitation, Adiris
 grabbed her sacred blade and swung it
            at her own foot, severing a toe. Then she offered the bloody
 part to the Gods, asking them to protect the woman. A silence fell over
 the followers, who revered Adiris as their new priestess.<br>Tales of 
her wealth, beauty, and devotion began
            to spread across the city as quickly as the disease. Soon, 
Adiris' followers called her the High Priestess of Babylon.<br>But her 
faith was tried when she showed the first signs of infection; her cough 
became a mix of phlegm and blood, her
            neck erupted in abscesses, and her four-toed foot darkened. 
Ashamed of her condition, she began wearing a veiled headpiece and 
carried a censer that masked the rancid smell of sick that clang to her 
skin. Hoping to be saved, she kept performing
            the rituals, offering blessed water and food to her 
followers.<br>But no ritual could save her. In a desperate attempt to 
appease the Gods, Adiris banished herself from the city. She traveled 
north with a few followers, venturing through
            the cold woodlands of Urashtu, until it was no longer 
possible to walk.<br>They camped in a damp cave, where Adiris lay in a 
pool of vomit. Her foot, which had turned black, was so swollen she 
could not go any further. Her followers and she
            realised the truth in that cave: they were all infected with
 the plague.<br>Kneeling among her retching followers, Adiris made one 
last prayer. The black fumes of incense rose into the damp air before 
being wiped off by a cold breeze.<br>Neither
            the body of Adiris nor those of her followers were ever 
found. Many told tales of her return, but no one truly knew what fate 
had befallen the High Priestess of Babylon.</div>

        <div class="lore">Honouring his family name was never enough for
 Kazan Yamaoka. He wanted to surpass his father's reputation and end 
what he saw as the thinning of samurai culture with farmers often posing
 as samurai. His father tried to turn Kazan's attention
            to more noble pursuits, but Kazan refused to heed his 
advice, and borrowing his father's Katana, he embarked on a dark 
pilgrimage to prove his worth and rid Japan of impostors. Ignoring the 
code that had been taught to him, Kazan killed impostors
            in the hills and the valleys, on the beaches and in the 
woodland. The killings were brutal, cruel and morbid. He humiliated 
farmers and warriors alike, yanking off their topknots and stripping 
them of their armour. His rage, bloodlust and
            perverse sense of honour knew no bounds. Monks believed he 
was possessed by something dark and otherworldly and cursed him while a 
noble lord began to call him 'Oni-Yamaoka,' the rageful Samurai, an 
insult both to Kazan and his family.<br>Determined
            to redeem his family's name, Kazan now butchered anyone who 
dared call him Oni-Yamaoka. The insult confused him. He had defeated the
 best and he had purified the samurai class by ridding the land of 
impostors. How could anyone refer to him
            as an ogre? Had it been because he had marched onto a 
battlefield to cut down the fiercest warriors. Had it been because he 
had taken a Kanabo and dashed hundreds of skulls with it? Or had it been
 because of his need to secure a 'trophy' from
            his victims. It didn't matter. Being called an ogre was more
 than he could bear and an ominous voice in his head urged him to strike
 down the lord who had desecrated his name.<br>As Kazan made for the 
lord's town, he suddenly found himself
            face to face with a samurai standing on a dirt road, 
blocking his way. Kazan readied his Kanabo. Without a word, the samurai 
attacked and quickly secured the upper hand. But he hesitated. With a 
devastating blow, Kazan crushed the samurai's
            head and cracked his helmet. As Kazan approached the fallen 
samurai, he saw his father's face and staggered back to his haunches. 
His father stared at Kazan with mingled shame and regret as he issued 
his last breath. Kazan closed his eyes
            and screamed in agony until he could scream no more. When he
 opened his eyes again... his father was gone. Not only had he killed 
his father, but he had allowed thieves to steal his body for armour.<br>Bitter,
 lost and disillusioned, Kazan
            roamed the land aimlessly with his father's voice rattling 
in his head, taunting him, reminding him of his failures, sending him 
into fits of uncontrollable black rage. One day, walking in the woods, 
Kazan happened upon an Oni statue. He stopped
            and stood motionless for a long moment. The weathered and 
overgrown statue seemed to be ridiculing him, accusing him of being the 
impostor samurai he had so desperately sought to destroy. Kazan shook 
the laughing voice out of his head and
            half remembered the lord who had ridiculed him as 
'Oni-Yamaoka.<br>With renewed anger, Kazan journeyed to a town high up 
in the snowy mountains where the lord resided. A dozen samurai met Kazan
 at the gates of the town. A dozen samurai fell
            to his Kanabo. His speed and strength were unmatched. His 
rage was incomprehensible. Covered in blood and gore, Kazan battled 
through the town and soon found the lord hiding in a villa. He dragged 
him out of a cabinet, sliced his tendons to
            immobilise him and watched him beg and squirm like a dog. 
Without hesitation, he thrust his fist into the lord's mouth and yanked 
out the wicked tongue that had desecrated his name.<br>Satisfied, Kazan 
exited the villa to find himself surrounded
            by dozens of farmers wielding rusted scythes, sharp 
pitchforks, and heavy clubs. He survived the first few assaults, but 
there were too many attackers coming from every direction. Within 
moments Kazan was on the ground staring at a cold, indifferent,
            darkening sky as farmers took turns stabbing and torturing 
the 'Oni' who had butchered their beloved lord. The frenzied mob dragged
 Kazan into a small stone mill to continue the torture and finally left 
him to die a slow, agonising death.
            When they returned, the mill was filled with a strange black
 fog and Kazan's body and the Kanabo were nowhere to be found. It was 
the beginning of a dark legend about a rageful Oni haunting the town.</div>

        <div class="lore">Growing up the son of a wealthy CEO was always
 going to put pressure on Jake Park. When his brother graduated with 
honours from Yale, the pressure on Jake intensified. Jake just wasn't 
the academic type, but his father never really understood
            his refusal to embrace the expensive education he lavished 
upon him. Eventually, Jake rebelled by dropping out of school entirely. 
Now, Jake lives off the grid on the edge of the woods. It's been years 
since he spoke to his father but his
            mother checks in once in a while. It was she, who eventually
 called the police. The cops said he got lost in the woods and a search 
party looked for days, but gave up as bad weather rolled in. Despite 
passionate pleas from his mother, they
            never resumed the search and Jake went down in history as

family reputation and legacy. During torture
            it's not pain that breaks a man, it's immense pressure. And 
Jake couldn't handle any more pressure. Instead he sought the opposite 
of fine dining and maids. He left the grid and ended up with a forest as
 closest neighbour. A self made outsider,
            Jake understands nature. He's not there to tame something - 
rather him becoming feral. Remove the brutal Killers that seek out blood
 to drain and Jake would feel just at home. No Wi-Fi. No Fortune-500

gaming world, however, she finally found respect. Nicknamed the "Shining

sanctuary free of the misconceptions and prejudice she had felt from her
 parents and the non-gaming world.<br>Feng Min pushed her limits to 
prove she was the best. Sleep was less
            important to her than training. At the top of her game, she 
filled stadiums with fans who adored her. But it couldn't last forever; 
The pressure to be the best grew stronger and stronger. She pushed 
herself too far, slept too little, and her
            performance began to slip. She started to lose. At night, 
she would stay up, tormented by the thought of disappointing her 
parents… and her fans.<br>She spiralled out of control and fell into a

            the streets and visiting bars, where no one knew of

somewhere completely different… in a never-ending nightmare. Feng Min

standing in front of her family, singing a song that she'd learned that 
morning at school, and watching smiles spread across their faces. Seeing
 how something as simple as a song could make people so
            happy was the moment when she knew what she wanted to do 
with her life.<br>She practised, learned the guitar as soon as she was 
big enough to reach over it, and was performing in front of crowds by 
the time she was eight years old. Her mother
            did everything she could to fulfil Kate's dreams, taking her
 all over their home state of Pennsylvania, then across the South, and 
even to Nashville itself.<br>Kate won folk music competitions and talent
 shows whenever she participated, but
            for her to win others had to lose, and that wasn't in her 
nature. She only wanted an outlet, a way to touch people's lives. To 
make them forget the worries of the world and just enjoy themselves, if 
only for a while.<br>With age came a new-found
            freedom. She bought a battered old Chevy truck and was able 
to travel around by herself, meeting fans and making new friends 
wherever she stopped. Hers wasn't a story of rock excess though: just 
the road, her guitar and maybe a good bourbon
            to end the day.<br>From sun-baked festivals to dark and cosy
 bars, people flocked to her voice and her self-penned songs of 
friendship, family, love and home.<br>These sentiments weren't just 
lip-service: she made sure to return home as
            often as she could, to help out in her community and 
entertain the local children with her tales of the wider world. She saw 
it as a way of giving back, of supporting others in the same way she had
 been.<br>It was home where she found most
            of her inspiration as well. She had always loved to take 
long walks in the woods around her town, exploring off the beaten track,
 finding a quiet spot to play and write her songs. She had a favourite 
location she returned to time and time
            again, a natural hollow, encircled by trees, that looked 
almost as if it had been blasted out of the rocks thousands of years 
ago.<br>Here she felt a strong connection to nature, and to the Earth itself. She let her mind be enveloped by the
            forest and it rewarded her with constant inspiration.<br>She
 picked up her guitar and played, her fingers dancing across the 
fretboard. The music that she made this time was unlike her usual 
uplifting tunes, being much more melancholy, even
            dark. Still, something compelled her to continue, to finish 
the song.<br>Around her, the leaves vibrated in unison with the guitar 
strings and the boughs of the trees lengthened, coalescing into a living
 form. Spider-like legs descended from
            the canopy above, grasping for her. Regaining her senses, 
she grabbed a rock and tried to beat them back, but their skin was hard 
as iron and the rock simply bounced off and skittered away.<br>The legs 
coiled like tendrils around her limbs
            and lifted her towards the darkness overhead. Fog rolled 
across the clearing, obscuring both Kate and the creature of nightmares 
that drew her up towards itself.<br>When the fog cleared, there was no sign of any struggle, or of life. Just
            an acoustic guitar, the scratch plate engraved with flowers; as well as the initials KD, inlaid in mother of pearl.</div>

thick of it.<br>It's during his years in college that he started to 
imagine his life elsewhere. While his close friends orbited the music 
industry, he followed a surer path. His grades
            granted him admission to higher education, and there was a 
demand for teachers abroad.<br>After graduating university, he taught 
extra classes to afford applying fees overseas. He had a steady diet of 
long commutes, grading piles, nightly
            lesson plans, and early classes. After a year, he managed to
 apply for a position abroad. His first plane ride took him to Southern 
Japan for a new start.<br>His life in Kagoshima was hectic. There was 
little time to do everything he took
            for granted back home. His Japanese was elementary at best, 
which slowed him down. Buying groceries took hours, long commutes had to
 be planned, and lesson plans relied on Japanese notions, which he had 
to learn.<br>But after a few months,
            he found his rhythm. He reflected on it one morning while 
riding the train to work. He no longer had to study the Kanji characters
 filling the map. He knew his way. His language skills had improved, he 
felt connected to his students, and he'd
            treat himself to luxurious restaurants on weekends. He even 
had his first vacation planned.<br>Within seconds, Adam's world was 
brought down to a slow motion. Rails hissed, bags came pouring down, and
 the floor trembled before the hit: Adam
            crashed forward as the train flipped upside down. He landed 
on a window pane as an unhinged door came flying at a passenger. He 
rolled over so that the door would hit him instead of the girl. He shut 
his eyes as he braced for impact, but nothing
            happened.
            <br>He squinted one eye open and he saw nothing but 
darkness. A heavy Fog had taken over the train. Ice seemed to flow 
through his body, reaching his lips first, then the tip of his fingers 
before spreading to his legs. Lulled by the warm
            hum of the dark whisper, he closed his eyes, drifting.<br>No
 one truly knows what happened to Adam Francis. The school teachers 
imagined the worst when they watched the train derailment on the news 
and saw he was missing. Their fears seemed
            to be confirmed when Adam's bag was recovered from the crash
 site, but his body was never found. To this day, his uncle believes 
that Adam took off after the train crash, alive still, somewhere out 
there.</div>

        <div class="overall"><b>Jeff Johansen</b> is a quiet artist with
 a heart of gold, standing steadfast against impossible odds. He has a 
dark past but led a quiet, simple life until his father passed, leaving 
things to sort out.</div>

            <div class="skills-name" id="sr26">Distortion</div>
        </div>
        <div class="lore">Jeff Johansen was born and raised in Ormond, 
Alberta. He grew up as a quiet, only child with an aversion for large 
crowds. During High School, his anxious nature was mislabelled as 
shyness, which he covered up with a tough, stoic persona that
            intimidated bullies and teachers alike. At home, he 
discovered an interest for heavy metal and started a vinyl collection. 
The evocative symbolism on the covers inspired him to make some art of 
his own, which helped him cope with his parents'
            constant fighting.<br>To escape his parent's increasingly 
recurrent blow-ups, Jeff started working at a video store. Few customers
 passed by, so he had a lot of free time to draw. A late-night regular 
noticed his sketches and asked him to
            do some artwork for his gang at the abandoned lodge up Mount
 Ormond. Jeff accepted the challenge and painted a large mural depicting
 "The Legion" in runny, bloody letters. He was given a fifty-dollar bill
 and a 12-pack for his hard work. It
            was his first paid commission, a milestone to be proud of.<br>After
 his parents' divorce, Jeff was forced to move with his mother to 
Winkler, Manitoba, which was miles away from his home town—and his dad. 
In Winkler, Jeff was more isolated
            than ever, except for art and music. His solace came shortly
 after graduating High School when he started working at a local bar 
with live music performances. He found a roadie gig shortly after, 
leaving Winkler behind.<br>A few years later,
            Jeff got injured after getting involved in a fight during a 
concert. He was told he could lose part of his eyesight, so his doctor 
asked him to stay in town in order to monitor him. It was a difficult 
time during which Jeff re-assessed his
            life choices.<br>He went back to school—art school. His 
eyesight slowly returned, but he had to be careful. He took a few 
courses, experimenting with a wide range of mediums, ultimately choosing
 oil painting and digital art, the latter of
            which offered paid intern-ships. He took up a desk job and 
found his calling in designing labels for microbreweries. He led a 
quiet, simple life: he brewed beer, took-in a rescue dog, designed 
tattoos, and freelanced album covers for bands
            he liked. All until one morning, when he got a phone call 
from Ormond saying that his father had passed, leaving a few things to 
sort out.<br>Jeff drove all the way back to Ormond. He felt a pang of 
nostalgia when he reached his late father's
            house. Inside, there was an old guitar case sitting in 
against the wall. It held a black, vintage model with a sticky note that
 said, "for my boy."<br>He stayed in town longer than he planned to, 
reminiscing about his childhood. Driving by
            his former High School, he remembered the mural he painted 
up Mount Ormond. He bought a 12-pack and headed to the lodge.<br>After 
weeks of not hearing back from Jeff, his colleagues assumed that grief 
had gotten the better of him. His neighbour
            got tired of sitting his dog, which became more and more 
agitated as days went by. The dog became a stray again, erring while 
seeking the familiar trail of Jeff's malty scent.</div>

        <div class="name"> Influential Celebrity</div>
        <div class="difficulty">Intermediate</div>
        <div class="overall"><b>Jane Romero</b> is an influential celebrity, going against the grain to tackle challenges head on.</div>

            <div class="skills-name" id="sr23">Solidarity</div>
        </div>
        <div class="lore">Jane Romero was the daughter of famous 
actress, Loretta Lawrence, of whom she had no memory. Her parents had 
separated when she was still a baby, mainly since her mother was often 
away filming. Jane was raised by her father, a struggling visual
            artist. She grew up torn between resenting her mother's 
absence from her life and admiring her presence on screen.<br>As a 
teenager, Jane secretly wished to emulate her mother's talent. She would
 direct and perform in plays, audition for
            TV commercials and help her father at his studio. During her
 senior year, she entered a national oratory contest and won first 
prize. Her performance attracted the attention of a radio station that 
contacted her for an interview. During the
            live show, her natural charm and repartee impressed the 
staff, who offered her a part-time job at the station.<br>After 
graduating college in Communication, she quit her job at the station to 
work for a trendy variety show. But her frank
            delivery and ad-libs were not appreciated by the show's 
executives, who fired her after five months. Desperate for another 
opportunity, Jane pitched a show at the radio station she used to work 
at, only to be turned down, her proposal being
            too risky.<br>Four months later, she received a phone call 
from a producer who had seen reruns of the show. He was looking for a 
co-host to spark up the failing show Quick Talk.<br>Live television 
meant long hours, a low salary, and no stability,
            but it also offered a platform to broadcast her views. She 
disputed the crude inflammatory tone of Quick Talk and pushed for a 
relate-able coverage of personal issues. Her honest delivery resonated 
with her audience and within weeks, the show's
            viewer-ship was steadily growing.<br>After two years, she 
launched a full-hour segment called The Jane Romero Show, which was 
broadcast nationally and covered tabooed topics, including her personal 
struggle with abandonment. Her show broke
            records and her initials J. R. became synonymous with 
products ranging from beauty creams to fashion accessories.<br>But Jane 
needed more; she wanted others to follow her in her footsteps. She 
published a memoir that covered her childhood
            with an absent mother. Her book was an instant best seller, 
but was reviewed harshly. Critics called it "a serving of sad anecdotes 
seasoned with bland, generic self-help tips." Jane took this criticism 
to heart, since despite her success,
            a voice in the back of her mind was starting to doubt her 
achievements. Her success also generated an increasingly demanding 
schedule and a growing pressure to entertain constantly. During a 
particularly tense week, she canned an episode and
            instead launched a two-hour-long special on divorce. Her 
stress peaked when she learnt that her mother had agreed to star in her 
show.<br>Jane put on a brave face and began the show. Most of it went 
without a hitch, but her mother walked
            on set, smiling warmly at the audience, Jane's stomach 
lurched unpleasantly. She was consumed by a violent envy that had been 
festering. Yet she carried on with a strained smile, until Loretta 
interrupted her, saying that they were not actually
            related. The interview went haywire after that.<br>After the
 show, Jane was driving to her father's house in New Jersey. She needed 
to talk things over with him; she had not been feeling like herself 
lately. She turned on a free-way along
            the coast to avoid major congestion and popped some 
painkillers to numb the throbbing pain in her temples, which had been 
nagging her all day. Then she started to relax and turned on the radio; 
classical music was playing. The drive was slow.
            Black ice covered the highway, which was packed with cars on
 their way back home. Night fell. A darkness began to blur the corners 
of her vision and turned the headlights into swirls of red. Jane blinked
 to sharpen their outlines, but each
            time she closed her eyes, her eyelids became heavier and 
heavier, until they remained shut for a moment too long.<br>The following morning, authorities were fishing out Jane's car from the water. Despite leading a meticulous search for weeks,
            they were unable to retrieve her body.<br>The airing and 
production of The Jane Romero Show was suspended until after her 
funeral, which both her father and mother attended.<br>As the public 
grieved for Jane, there was a surge of orders
            for J. R. products and all her episodes were re-released a 
month later, with an opening credit that wished her eternal peace.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="lore">Despite her traditional upbringing, Yui Kimura
 raced scooters in her hometown of Hida where she earned the reputation 
of being able to do the impossible with very little. Her father did his 
best to steer her away from what he believed to be masculine
            pursuits, but her grandmother secretly shared her 
grandfather's engineer manuals and notes on car and motorcycle engines. 
Yui read her grandfather's manuals and learned fast. She was able to not
 only maintain her scooter, but she modified
            the engine so that she could compete with older boys on 
motor crosses. With her grandfathers 'good luck hachimaki' wrapped 
around her arm, she raced local boys who, unable to keep up with her, 
worked together to orchestrate her defeat. No
            luck for them. Yui outmanoeuvred them at every turn and 
became a sensation to all her friends. When it came time to apply for 
school, Yui gathered her courage and confessed her ambition to race 
motorcycles to her father. An altercation ensued
            and when Yui refused to apply for a proper education, her 
father felt a great shame and told her she was no longer welcome in 
their home. With a heavy heart, Yui left for Nagoya with the blessings 
and savings of her grandmother.<br>Nagoya
            was not what Yui expected. She could only find low grade 
clerical work or minor jobs as a hostess. With the last of the money her
 grandmother gave her, she purchased a racing bike and entered illegal 
street races where she won more money than
            she had ever seen. Rumours of her courage and quick reflexes
 spread like wildfire. Soon she had an unofficial retinue of women 
motorcyclists wearing Yui's signature pink. Along with a gang following 
her, Yui realised she had a stalker following
            her in the shadows. When Yui realised her lucky handkerchief
 had been stolen from her apartment, she took her concerns to the police
 who laughed and dismissed her, saying her stalker was probably a nice 
guy and that she would probably marry
            him in the near future.<br>One evening Yui returned home to 
find the stalker in her apartment going through her things. He hadn't 
seen her, and she wasn't sure what she should do. But the sight of him 
going through her clothes was too much
            to bear. She yelled for him to leave. The stalker turned to 
her with a knife. He lunged at her. She evaded his attack, and he hit 
the wall and dropped his knife. Without hesitation, Yui tackled him. 
They rolled over the ground exchanging desperate
            blows. Yui took more blows than she had ever experienced 
racing scooters in Shirakawa. With a surge of adrenaline, she managed to
 overpower her stalker, snatching the knife from the floor and holding 
the razor-sharp blade to his neck.<br>When
            the police reached her apartment, they took him away and 
rushed Yui to the hospital for trauma. X-rays revealed she had broken 
her arm and foot in several places. It wasn't long before her gang 
showed up one by one and together they helped
            her pay her medical bills. Rehabilitation was difficult but 
Yui never gave up and with the support of her gang she was ready for the
 races. Yui's first race after the attack her gang presented her with a 
new pink hachimaki with their signatures
            and good luck messages written all over it. Yui vowed she 
would help other women with her winnings and influence. True to her 
word, her gang became known as the Sakura 7 Gang and they wore pink 
hachimakis as a symbol of unity and support for
            women needing help from stalkers and abusers.<br>The Sakura 7
 grew beyond the 7 members and Yui's signature pink became synonymous 
with women's empowerment. At street races women would line up in droves 
to support her. After winning seven
            straight races in a row, she attracted the attention of a 
sponsor. She not only earned a spot at the All-Japan Moto Championship 
but was the youngest woman to race and win in the prestigious event. Her
 sponsorship soon tripled. So, too, did
            her gang. But everything came to a staggering halt at the 
illegal TK3 (Tokyo Kick 3000) street races. Yui was leading the race 
until she entered an unnatural fog that seemed to have appeared from 
nowhere. Baffled and confused, she stopped
            her bike and dismounted. It wasn't long before she realised 
she wasn't in Tokyo anymore.</div>
